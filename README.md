# Python-Reddit-RPG
A simple text adventure game built in Python that uses the praw api to retrieve data from Reddit. I cobbled this project together for the https://boot.dev 2025 Hackathon, so it is very incomplete at the moment.
# Features
- Combat system vs other reddit users (still in progress).
- The ability to connect your reddit account to translate your karma into in-game stats.
- Travel between subreddits in-game.
- Comment farms, these use your reddit comment stats (upvotes, views, etc.) to allow you to unlock weapons and armor.
# Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- import the Praw api and random
# Running
- Check the commands.txt for how to play.
- run "hackathon reddit game.py"
